# Py-tic-tac-toe
Basic tic-tac-toe in Python

To play, run "__init__.py"

There are two sets of tests:
    tests/tests.py, and
    tests/tests_live.py

tests.py needs the self.start() line of Game.__init__() to be commented out
before running.

tests_live.py requires PYTHONPATH to be set to Py-tic-tac-toe as the last dir.
Expect an EOL error. If an AssertionError is raised, a test is not passing.
